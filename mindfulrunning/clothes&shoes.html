                <p>
                    One of the most common concerns for marathon runners is how to prevent injuries that can derail their training or prevent them from reaching their goal. 
                    While there is no foolproof way to avoid injuries, there are some steps you can take to reduce the likelihood and severity of them. Here are some of them:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="cesBackgroundFirst"></div>
            <div id="cesBackgroundSecond"></div>
            <div class="ces-text-first">
                <!-- <h2>Warm up properly before each run</h2> -->
                <p> 
                    Your shoes and clothing can have a significant impact on your running comfort and performance, as well as your injury risk. 
                    You should wear shoes that fit well, provide adequate cushioning, and support, and match your foot type and running style. 
                    You can find out your foot type by doing a wet test, where you wet your foot and step on a paper towel or a cardboard. 
                    If you see a full imprint of your foot, you have a flat foot or a low arch. If you see a narrow band connecting the heel and the forefoot, you have a high arch. 
                    If you see a moderate curve along the inside edge, you have a normal arch. 
                    Based on your foot type, you can choose shoes that offer different levels of stability, cushioning, and motion control. 
                    You can also visit a specialty running store or a podiatrist to get a professional fitting or a custom-made orthotic. 
                    You should also replace your shoes every 300 to 500 miles, or when they show signs of wear and tear.
                </p>
                <!-- <h2>Stretch regularly and gently</h2> -->
                <!-- <p>
                    Stretching can help you improve your flexibility, range of motion, and posture, as well as prevent muscle tightness and imbalances that can lead to injuries. 
                    However, you should stretch only when your muscles are warm and relaxed, such as after your warm-up or cool-down, or on your rest days. 
                    You should also stretch gently and gradually, without bouncing or forcing your movements. You should hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds, 
                    and repeat it two to three times for each major muscle group.
                </p> -->
            </div>
            <img class="ces-img-first" src="images/shoes_img_f.jpg" alt="Woman stretching">
            <div class="ces-text-second">
                <!-- <h2>Cool down properly after each run</h2> -->
                <p>
                    You should wear clothing that is breathable, moisture-wicking, and comfortable, and that protects you from the weather conditions. 
                    You should also avoid wearing cotton or other materials that can cause chafing or blisters. 
                    You should dress according to the season and the temperature, and follow the rule of thumb of dressing as if it is 10 degrees warmer than it actually is. 
                    This is because your body temperature will rise as you run, and you don't want to overheat or sweat too much. 
                    You should also wear layers that you can easily add or remove as needed. 
                    For example, in cold weather, you should wear a base layer that wicks away sweat, a mid layer that insulates heat, and an outer layer that blocks wind and rain. 
                    In hot weather, you should wear light-colored and loose-fitting clothing that allows air circulation and reflects sunlight. 
                    You should also wear accessories such as hats, gloves, sunglasses, or sunscreen to protect yourself from the sun, wind, or cold. 
                    By wearing proper shoes and clothing, you can improve your running comfort and performance, as well as reduce the risk of injury. 
                    However, you should also remember that shoes and clothing are not magic bullets that can prevent all injuries. 
                    You should still follow the other steps mentioned above, such as warming up, cooling down, stretching, following the 10% rule and the hard-easy principle, 
                    and resting and recovering adequately.
