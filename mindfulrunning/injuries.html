                <h2>How to prevent injuries?</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most common concerns for marathon runners is how to prevent injuries that can derail their training or prevent them from reaching their goal. 
                    While there is no foolproof way to avoid injuries, there are some steps you can take to reduce the likelihood and severity of them. Here are some of them:

                <h2>Warm up properly before each run</h2>
                <p> 
                    A warm-up is a low-intensity activity that prepares your body for the higher-intensity activity that follows. 
                    It can help you increase your blood flow, oxygen delivery, muscle temperature, and joint mobility, as well as prevent muscle cramps and strains. 
                    A warm-up can consist of walking, jogging, skipping, or dynamic stretches for 10 to 15 minutes before your run.
                </p>
                <h2>Stretch regularly and gently</h2>
                <p>
                    Stretching can help you improve your flexibility, range of motion, and posture, as well as prevent muscle tightness and imbalances that can lead to injuries. 
                    However, you should stretch only when your muscles are warm and relaxed, such as after your warm-up or cool-down, or on your rest days. 
                    You should also stretch gently and gradually, without bouncing or forcing your movements. You should hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds, 
                    and repeat it two to three times for each major muscle group.

                <h2>Cool down properly after each run</h2>
                <p>
                    A cool-down is a low-intensity activity that helps your body return to its normal state after the higher-intensity activity that preceded it. 
                    It can help you lower your heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, as well as flush out the metabolic waste products 
                    and reduce muscle soreness and stiffness. A cool-down can consist of walking, jogging, or static stretches for 10 to 15 minutes after your run.
