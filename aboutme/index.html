    <h2>Amon</h2>
    <p>Hello there, I've been married for about 14 years and have 3 kids. I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, 
        I was born, raised up, and served on a mission right here.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout my life (35 years). 
        I love to study the Gospel and serve my neighbor.</p>
    <p>Despite my solid career as a Software Architect, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Web Development and Computer Programming. 
        I really like developing software and designing bold solutions to all kinds of business needs. 
        I believe that anyone can change the world through technology, building smart, reliable, and easy-to-use software.</p>
    <p>I hope I can contribute to the success of this class. Count on me for every help you guys need. </p>
